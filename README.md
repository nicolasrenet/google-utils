## Purpose

Use Google API to retrieve Google appfile from a locally mounted Google-drive.


## Usage

```bash
./google-appfiles-download.py <locally mounted google drive folder path>
```

## TODO:

+ because it uses the API, acquiring a key is necessary before using the script: should use Gdown instead to retrieve the file through HTTP.
